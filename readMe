🏎️ Mario Kart ML Tutor
Mario Kart ML Tutor is a hands-on machine learning project that uses data from Mario Kart 8 Deluxe to teach ML concepts. The project guides users through a complete workflow, from data preparation to real-time predictions, making complex topics fun and easy to understand.

🚀 Live Demo
Check out the interactive app here: 👉 https://mario-kart-ml.streamlit.app

✨ Features
Interactive Streamlit App: A live demo where you can test different kart setups and predict winning combinations.
Step-by-Step Tutorials: Jupyter notebooks that walk you through the entire machine learning pipeline.
Real-World Data: Built on a Kaggle dataset containing in-game statistics for drivers, karts, tires, and gliders.
Educational Focus: Includes challenges and questions to reinforce key concepts like feature engineering and model evaluation.
Binary Classification: Uses a model to predict the probability of a specific kart combination winning a race.
