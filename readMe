# 🎮 Mario Kart ML Tutor

**Mario Kart ML Tutor** is an educational machine learning project built around *Mario Kart 8 Deluxe*. It helps learners understand and apply machine learning techniques through a complete and engaging pipeline—from data processing to real-time prediction—using game data.

## 🚀 Features

-  Step-by-step tutorials covering essential and advanced ML concepts  
-  Game stats based on this [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marlowspringmeier/mario-kart-8-deluxe-ingame-statistics)  
-  Code samples for data preparation, model training, and evaluation  
-  Binary classification model to predict winning combinations  
-  Interactive **Streamlit app** to test kart setups and predictions  
-  Educational challenges and reflection questions  

## 🔧 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Mario-kart-ML-tutor.git
   cd Mario-kart-ML-tutor
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Launch the app**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
   ```

You can also explore the Jupyter notebooks to follow the learning process step by step.
